<h1>strange habits</h1>
<h2>what is going on?</h2>
<p>
  i recently bought a screen-printing kit in the hopes of making some t-shirts. <br>
  i'm making this website in the hopes of writing about what that's like and <br>
  maybe selling the shirts if that seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>
  ideally i will do everything myself, which so far has included designing, <br>
  printing, and documenting this process. i don't really have any idea what's <br>
  going on, and i still have my full time job and other hobbies and <br>
  responsibilities, so we will see how this goes. <br>
</p>
