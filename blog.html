<h3>08/15/25 - lots of progress!</h3>
<p class="text-wrap">
it has been about a bit under two months since i wrote on here, but i have
been doing lots of screenprinting! i've made some shirts for different events i've
gone to (dead&co, outsidelands), and some silly ones for myself and friends. i think
it's pretty safe to say i have a decent grasp on the basic one-color flow, although i 
am a bit constrained by the fact that i am working in my apartment with minimal equipment.
one downside to this is it's difficult to reclaim my screens without a pressure washer.
i did recently invest in a 4-station press but i've yet to do any multi-color prints, so
that's the next big step. i've been thinking about making 10-20 shirts of some basic
design and seeing if i could sell them at dolores park or something, so maybe the next
post will give an update on how that went. until next time (i will add some pictures 
to this post, soon) tjc

<h3>06/26/25 - second attempt</h3>

<p class="text-wrap">this was my second attempt a few days later on june 26, 2025. i tested my
hypotheses from my first run and used way less emulsion and exposed the screen a bit
more precisely (who knew following instructions would help?) anyways, this try was
way more successful, although still not without user error as i exposed the image 
mirrored o_O. not pictured here but i also messed around with mixing two inks 
(blue+red) and it came out nicely. while not perfect, i think this was a 
big step in the right direction. next i want to try a more complex image with less 
margin of error compared to plain text. tjc  </p>
<h3>06/22/25 - first attempt</h3>
<img src="images/first_attempt.jpg" alt="first attempt" width="302" height="403">
<p class="text-wrap">this was my first attempt on june 22, 2025. i wanted to just print my address
onto a shirt as a test run, but obviously i ended up with some sorta failed MoMA
exhibit. in terms of what went wrong- i'm pretty sure i used far too much emulsion,
which didn't dry at all. i also think i didn't expose the image long enough under the UV,
resulting in essentially everything washing out. honestly, i was just happy seeing
ink on the shirt, and it gave me a good excuse to practice reclaiming the screen
which went pretty well as far as i could tell. tjc</p>
