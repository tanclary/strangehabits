<h3>02/24/26 - many shirts among other things</h3>
<p class="text-wrap">
    ok another 6 months has passed. i never added the pictures i said i was going to add.
    i needed to collect them all into a folder or something. i hate aggregating things
    after the fact. anyway, screenprinting has been going awesome. i've gotten to show
    lots of friends how to do it. i've messed around with some fancier screens. i even
    had a beautiful 305 count screen and she was gorgeous. maybe i'll put a picture. i
    was borrowing a friend's power washer for screen reclaiming, and i just washed too
    close to the sun. tore a hole right down the left side. i've done a couple of multicolor
    prints, although only one legitimately required separating the channels. it was of
    the north carolina license plate, which i liked. i'm still really interested in text,
    and geometric, fine-lined designs. i've tried doing a couple prints of photos to mixed
    results. if i decide to invest further, i think i'd probably get a nicer printer that
    can handle bigger designs. but yeah, the social aspect of it has been great. i love
    teaching my friends something and they all seem pretty happy with how theirs turn out.
    next things to work on are: printing on black shirts, continuing to work on halftones,
    and more multicolor prints. i also should figure out how to use that giant press i
    bought. doing this all manually is fun for one-offs but if i wanna make several of a
    shirt, some degree of consistency across prints would be useful. will be out of town
    for a while, but hopefully i'll at least keep designing during that time. my photoshop
    is still completely amateur, but i am slowly becoming more acquainted. -------

    peace and love, tjc

<h3>08/15/25 - lots of progress!</h3>
<p class="text-wrap">
it has been about a bit under two months since i wrote on here, but i have
been doing lots of screenprinting! i've made some shirts for different events i've
gone to (dead&co, outsidelands), and some silly ones for myself and friends. i think
it's pretty safe to say i have a decent grasp on the basic one-color flow, although i 
am a bit constrained by the fact that i am working in my apartment with minimal equipment.
one downside to this is it's difficult to reclaim my screens without a pressure washer.
i did recently invest in a 4-station press but i've yet to do any multi-color prints, so
that's the next big step. i've been thinking about making 10-20 shirts of some basic
design and seeing if i could sell them at dolores park or something, so maybe the next
post will give an update on how that went. until next time (i will add some pictures 
to this post, soon) tjc

<h3>06/26/25 - second attempt</h3>
<img src="images/second_attempt.jpg" alt="first attempt" width="302" height="403">
<p class="text-wrap">this was my second attempt a few days later on june 26, 2025. i tested my
hypotheses from my first run and used way less emulsion and exposed the screen a bit
more precisely (who knew following instructions would help?) anyways, this try was
way more successful, although still not without user error as i exposed the image 
mirrored o_O. not pictured here but i also messed around with mixing two inks 
(blue+red) and it came out nicely. while not perfect, i think this was a 
big step in the right direction. next i want to try a more complex image with less 
margin of error compared to plain text. tjc  </p>
<h3>06/22/25 - first attempt</h3>
<img src="images/first_attempt.jpg" alt="first attempt" width="302" height="403">
<p class="text-wrap">this was my first attempt on june 22, 2025. i wanted to just print my address
onto a shirt as a test run, but obviously i ended up with some sorta failed MoMA
exhibit. in terms of what went wrong- i'm pretty sure i used far too much emulsion,
which didn't dry at all. i also think i didn't expose the image long enough under the UV,
resulting in essentially everything washing out. honestly, i was just happy seeing
ink on the shirt, and it gave me a good excuse to practice reclaiming the screen
which went pretty well as far as i could tell. tjc</p>
