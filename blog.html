<h3>06/26/25 - second attempt</h3>
<img src="images/second_attempt.jpg" alt="first attempt" width="302" height="403">
<p class="text-wrap">this was my second attempt a few days later on june 26, 2025. i tested my
hypotheses from my first run and used way less emulsion and exposed the screen a bit
more precisely (who knew following instructions would help?) anyways, this try was
way more successful, although still not without user error as i exposed the image 
mirrored o_O. not pictured here but i also messed around with mixing two inks 
(blue+red) and it came out nicely. while not perfect, i think this was a 
big step in the right direction. next i want to try a more complex image with less 
margin of error compared to plain text. tjc  </p>
<h3>06/22/25 - first attempt</h3>
<img src="images/first_attempt.jpg" alt="first attempt" width="302" height="403">
<p class="text-wrap">this was my first attempt on june 22, 2025. i wanted to just print my address
onto a shirt as a test run, but obviously i ended up with some sorta failed MoMA
exhibit. in terms of what went wrong- i'm pretty sure i used far too much emulsion,
which didn't dry at all. i also think i didn't expose the image long enough under the UV,
resulting in essentially everything washing out. honestly, i was just happy seeing
ink on the shirt, and it gave me a good excuse to practice reclaiming the screen
which went pretty well as far as i could tell. tjc</p>
